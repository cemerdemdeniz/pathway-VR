# pathwayVR

This is a Mobile VR Game, developed with the [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/) game engine. I've developed the project to improve my coding skills.# Unity Dijkstra's Pathfinding

**Note**: Not being maintained by me, it was just an experiment for learning unity and c# concepts ((I may publish a complete package for this manner in future))

Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm Unity Implementation.

It is the implementation of [Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) in [Unity (Game Engine)](https://unity3d.com) that let's you find the shortest path between two Nodes in a Graph.

In this example we are going to find the shortest path from **Node A** to **Node F**:
